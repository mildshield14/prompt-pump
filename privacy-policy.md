# PromptPump Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 05 Aug 2025_

PromptPump (“we”, “our”, “app”) connects to your Strava account at your request in order to display **only your own workouts** and generate personal insights.

### What we collect
* Your Strava access token  
* Activity data that Strava returns (workout name, distance, time, etc.)

### Where it’s stored
* The access token and activity data stay **only in your browser’s session storage**.  
* We do **not** send your data to any third-party servers or analytics providers.

### Data retention & deletion
* Close the browser tab or log out → the token and data are immediately deleted.  
* Because we never store data on our servers, nothing persists after logout.

### Revoking access
You can revoke PromptPump’s access any time in **Strava → Settings → My Apps**.

### Contact
For questions or data-deletion requests, email **vennilasooben1401@gmail.com**.
